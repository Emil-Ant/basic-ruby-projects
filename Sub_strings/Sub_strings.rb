# implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first assignement and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary)
# as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and
# how many times it was found

# FIRST TODO: figure out how to find count for each element in the array
